README_enigmacnvtest

This folder contains all the necessary files to test if the CNV-calling script runs smoothly on your system.
Also, the files of this folder might also be useful (for comparison) to check that the format of your files is correct.

Docker-specifics:
-please open docker prior to running
[and note: the script has only been tested on Mac. Windows may be different]

Singularity-specifics:
-please specify the correct path for the singularity container (enigma-cnv.sif) in the script or place the singularity-container in the analysis-folder.

To run, please download the folder and run the script (ENIGMA-CNV_CNVProtocol_v2_docker_protocoltest.sh or ENIGMA-CNV_CNVProtocol_v2_singularity_protocoltest.sh) from the terminal (according to the instructions in the script itself).

Outputfiles should be two folders:
enigmatest_output/ [47 files]
enigmatest_visualize/ [7 files, 4 folders - QCplots/ [6 files], singleplots_50kb/ [6 files], singleplots_cnvofinterest/ [4 files], stackplots [3 files] ]
  in addition to:
ENIGMA-CNV_logfile.txt
