This folder containers examples on how files used in the ENIGMA-CNV CNV calling protocol should look.

"DatasetName_Covar_ENIGMACNV.csv"
-example, a comma-delimited ENIGMA-CNV covariate file format (one line per individual in the dataset).

"hhall.hg18.gcmodel"
-example of gcmodel-file

"hhall.hg18.pfb"
-example of pfb-file

"hhall.hmm"
-example of hmm-file

"HM3_b37mds2R.mds.csv"
-example of the comma-delimited MDS-covariate-file (one line per individual in the dataset).

"IlluminaFinalReport_Example.txt"
-example, IlluminaFinalReport.txt-file (for first few lines, number of lines should correspond the number of individuals in the dataset times the number of SNPs on the genotyping array)

"KeepFile.txt"
-format of the text-file with the individuals you want to keep  

"RemoveFile.txt"
-format of the text-file with the individuals you want to remove

"SNPPositionFile.txt"
-example of the tab-delimited SNP-position file (first few lines, number of lines should correspond to the number of SNPs on the genotyping array)

"SexFile.txt"
-example of the tab-delimited file specifying SampleID (as in the IlluminaFinalReport-file) and sex (one line per individual in dataset).

"SubjID1"
